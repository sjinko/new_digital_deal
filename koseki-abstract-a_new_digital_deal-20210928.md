abstract: The lack of policy frameworks for digital trust and data privacy exposes urban planners and designers to the risk of increasing inequalities when they conceive urban territory using digital tools and technology. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, many urban policy and governance scholars called to readdress contemporary forms of citizenships. In leveraging telecommunication technology in order to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, the rapid and sometime unplanned unfolding of digital solutions has disrupted several aspects of the urban social contract. One of the most pregnant consequences of this change concerns citizens’ relationship to data privacy and digital trust. While new forms of interactive democracy frameworks offer potential solutions to generate ideas and awareness on issues pertaining to citizenship and digitisation, they have, in most cases, focused on other topics. This article delineates the development of a *New Digital Deal* that would result from such framework. It highlight how a series of citizen assemblies on digital citizenship would contribute to making urban societies more resilient to the rapid transformation of their digital ecosystem. By looking at recent cases of national citizen assemblies in Europe, it defines the means and the requirements for such a process to take place in across national and transnational contexts. A *New Digital Deal* would therefore not only have tremendous benefits on the right and protection of citizens across the globe, but also lay the foundation for more just and fair development of urban territories.

## Introduction
Public trust in decision-makers, researchers and technology is critical to overcome the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. So far, national and transnational responses by governments, the scientific community and the private sector to the rapide spread of the virus have been central to limit the number of victims. Among non-medical measures put in place to mitigate the consequence of the pandemic, data-based solutions heated the already existing debate over digital trust and privacy, with contact tracing and digital passes as the main *technology-of-concern*. The deployment of such systems exposes the failure of the current model of digital governance, but an alternative model remains remains to be defined.

### General field(s) leading to the gaps (x 3)
	>> This section should point to the three contributions of a digital new deal to reinstate trust towards technology and stake-holders: 1) explain what went wrong (where do people agree and disagree) 2) find common objectives and identify possible issues 3) articulate a plan to reach these objectives
	
#### 1) explain what went wrong (where do people agree and disagree)
Digital technology is now omnipresent, in almost every single corner of the Earth. 

... Where do people agree and disagree is still unclear.

#### 2) find common objectives and identify possible issues

... but it is unclear what how to define common objectives for digital governance

#### 3) articulate a plan to reach these objectives

... the way that objective be reach is not yet clear.



By reaching all corners of the Earth in just a few months, this pandemic proves to be the most significant event in the history of humankind, and has already disrupted the lives of every single member of our specie. 


This, because, the COVID-19 pandemic comes at a time when connectivity – either though mobility or telecommunication – is virtually omnipresent, making it almost impossible for someone not to be directly affected by the virus or by the measures put in place to mitigate its spread. 


survey the spread of the virus in the population or to reduce risks of exposure 

reduce risks of infection and control the spread heated the already existing debate over digital trust and privacy, 





All around the globe, most measures triggered a certain push-back from citizens concerned with governments’ infringement on their civil rights and liberties. Among non-medical measures, data-based solutions heated the already existing debate over digital trust and privacy, with contact tracing and digital passes as the main *technology-of-concern*. This made obvious the inadequacy of current digital governance with citizens’ aspirations, and highlighted the need for a paradigm shift in the way we conceive and use digital technology to achieve a greater good.

What I present in this article builds on exchanges and discussions I had within three separate contexts. The first context consisted in a series of exchanges and discussions within a group of five digital governance scholars on the impact of the pandemic on digital trust and privacy. As researchers in the social science, the humanities and engineering quickly tried to help mitigate the sanitary crisis, I consulted with these experts whom I knew would bring thought-provoking and disruptive ideas to the table. This resulted in a series of propositions on how we could address the pandemic from the perspective of critical data studies, digital policy-making and information science.

The second context consisted in a series of panels and seminars I have been organizing since 2019 on the governance and technical implementation of AI in cities across political, scientific, civic and corporate organizations of the Global South and the Global North. From this experience, I learned much about the divergent and convergent forms of knowledge and understanding of data-centered practices in research, business and politics. These events helped me better understand the ramification of digital intelligence and gather a sense of the multiplicity of meanings we attribute to the digital. 

The third context consists in an on-going research work on democratic and citizen-driven governance. This research, which I develop with a network of researchers, teachers, civil servants and social innovators has recently focused on large-scale deliberative and interactive democratic processes. One recent example of such process we were allowed to observe was the Citizen Convention for Climate, which took place in France in 2019-2020. Another was the French public debate on agriculture which defined France’s strategic plan for the European Union’s Common Agricultural Policy.

  




I argue that the apparent trade-off between privacy and health at the core of the pandemic calls for a “new digital deal” to safeguard social cohesion and trust towards politics, science and industry. Because of the current epidemiological turn in surveillance technology, the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 revealed a legitimacy crisis, for which decision-makers were unprepared. Rooted in growing informational and digital divides, and a lack of trustworthy infrastructure for knowledge sharing, the crisis crystalized on-going ideological feuds occurring within and between nations, international organizations and multinational corporations. In what follows, I address three questions: How could a new digital deal–based on a global civic effort–contribute to increase trust while maintaining our efforts to eradicate the virus? How to achieve it? What are the obstacles that prevent the emergence of such an endeavor? Given the size of the task, I don’t intend to provide conclusive answers to these interrogations but hereby calling for urban planners, designers and theoreticians to join the discussion on a new digital deal that better suit the urban nature of the digital future. 

To reach such objective, I organize this article as follow. First, I look back at the evolution of digital ecosystems, and how they defined the way digital governance is conducted until today, highlighting the shift of paradigm provided by the hegemonic rise of urban data. Second, ...

## Context

### Governing the Digital

~~Along the Twentieth century, an ever increasing amount of information has been transferred from analogue to digital supports. With increasing stocking capacity, digital supports reduce greatly the need for storage space. Additionally, digitization provide unprecedented means to produce unlimited number of copies of documents, but also to directly process the information through computation. Because computation relies on the simple operations~~

Since the 1950s, digitization as led to a series of tools, norms, and know-how, known as digital ecosystems. While digitization has produced many types of digital spaces, we can link the evolution of digital governance to three of the main digital ecosystems: corporations, governments and cities.

Digital ecosystems first emerged within large technology corporations such as IBM and later Microsoft. While developing services and products that would soon trigger the digital revolution, corporations also began recording into digital logs increasingly large amount of information about the computational process itself, or metadata. Metadata, or data about data are integral part of the computational process, without which it cannot function. These digital logs would be stored temporarily in case of need and be eventually wiped out to allow for new metadata. Eventually, corporations began producing data not only as part of their products and services, but also by implementing these in internally in the management of the companies. Employee records, time tracking, internal memos, and other day-to-day processes akin to large corporations served as test-ground yet-to-be-defined potential of computational technology. Rapidly, these would inspire other large organization to do so with their own employees, customers, and numerous of individuals but also products they would need to “manage.”

In the 1970s, governments began implementing record technology, first by digitizing internal management documents, like corporations had done. The benefit of digitizing relative-to-then large amount of all kind of information recorded onto sheets of papers and other analogue means would quickly become apparent. This included population records and demographic data, police records and other government held data about individual citizens, groups of citizens and shares of the population. At this stage, digitization had not yet triggered  much difference in the type of information, and even collection techniques used by governments. It had merely just allow to record and eventually archive the same data unto non-physical supports, which could be easily stored, shared and reproduced, with fewer means and effort than previously. In other words, the ontology of the data, the way information is organized and labeled into variables had not. Just like in nineteenth century survey, people were still “dataified” into gender, age, ethnic background, wage, etc. Even the analysis of such information has not changed much within government agencies, and few innovations such as spatial analysis and social network analysis are not conducted for governmental purpose despite their revolutionary output in the corporate and scientific spheres. Yet, because the digitization process had emerged out of large corporations, it retained most of the corporate ways of doing. This is still enforced by both digital corporations that provide digital solutions to governments and trough non-governmental organisation that establish technical norms, such as ISO and IEEE. To To this day, only three governmental entities somewhat succeed in counterbalancing the hegemony of private corporations in global digital governance: the European Union and the United-States. The process of digitization, which has emerged most in the Western Hemisphere of the Global North has until recently imposed its ethnocentric functing to the rest of the world. Following Japan’s declining influence as a economic and technological superpower, China has emerged in the last few years as the only non-Western Governement capable of not only regulating its own digital economy, but conceive and diffuse its own digital norms. This occurs at a time when the focus of digitization rapidly shifts from the two existing digital ecosystems to a new one: the urban.

The urban digital ecosystem emerged at the crossroad of corporations and governments. Following the dot com revolution, both corporations and government increasingly 

* The urban digital ecosystem results from two factor: 
     * the increasing amount of metadata produced by individuals
     * the density of people associated with urban contexts



With the emergence of urban environments as the third-wave digital ecosystems, both corporate and governmental governance frameworks seem inadequate to establish citizens’s trust. This led to the governance crisis we saw at play during the pandemic. 

Table 1 shows how we can characterize the

| Ecosystem   | metric      | scale          | substance |
|--------------|:-----------:|:--------------:|:---------:|
| corporate    | employees   | transnational  | activities |
| government  | citizens    | national       | attributes |
| urban        | individuals | global         | events      |

*Rigid data ontologies do now allow for non-registered individuals. This risks of increasing repression*


To date, public trust in digital contact tracing methods built mainly on the legitimacy of stakeholders. Through the pandemic, political, academic and corporate leaders have formed alliances engaging their reputation and making an unprecedented commitment to facilitate eachother’s access to sensitive data. For example, governments enforcing the collection of personal data by private companies, private companies allowing academic institutions to analyze their users’ digital traces, and academic institutions providing infrastructure for governmental data storage and processing raise many questions: Are we normalizing surveillance technology? How can we guarantee accountability when faced with such an alliance? What role can the legal system and civic society play in balancing this trade-off? A new digital deal would address a growing uncertainty on, for example, the constitutional basis of digital governance, and how to guarantee a just distribution of resources and power in the digital economy.

The lack of policy frameworks for digital trust and data privacy exposes urban planners and designers to the risk of increasing inequalities when they conceive urban territory using digital tools and technology. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, many urban policy and governance scholars called to readdress contemporary forms of citizenships. Moreover, the pandemic has shown the limitation of the legislative tools such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For example, it is not clear whether this regulation applies to citizens of the European Union only or anyone who steps foot within the Union’s territory. The pandemic fostered a cognitive disjuncture in the terminology of trust and trusted systems, blurring the boundaries between technical trust and political trust, which need to remain separate. A new digital deal may thus provide useful insights on how to mitigate the risk that technical trust teints political trust and vice versa.

### Citizen-centric governance (example from Green New Deal, Citizen Convention, the Common Agricultural Policy, the Global Internet Convention? etc.)

Can we imagine governing the urban digital ecosystem through citizen-centered processes instead of allowing for large corporations and accomplice governments to dictate the how and what of our digital lives? The solution might not be a revolution, which would require unproductive confrontation. Instead, I propose building on the existing democratic experimentations going on in many different countries trying to regulate 


## A New Digital Deal

### Why

A new digital deal would serve to develop a value-based framework for digital governance. 

### Obstacles (problems)

There are also enormous organizational obstacles to defining a global new digital deal. The task would be easier for smaller and more urbanized countries in which every citizen is registered than for larger states in which a random selection of participants is virtually impossible. The leap for Southern countries is larger than for Northern nations who have the means and instruments to organize national citizen assemblies, largely due to the cost of transport or developing secure communication channels among participants. In terms of approaches, ideological frameworks in progressive and conservative countries present different challenges to implementing measures. Some countries also would recognize the place of marginalized minorities or women, while others only value the legitimacy of dominant groups. Certain countries already embrace interactive democracy while others see no added value in such a process.

Hence, perhaps the thorniest challenge exists on the geopolitical side. A new digital deal would require a coordinated effort from all countries, including some whose value system may not embrace citizens-centric processes. The diversity of approaches by national authorities highlights the risk of losing the public’s trust in proposed measures. A global framework of accountability for governments, academia and corporations, yet, remains needed to gain public trust in digital contact tracing and thus eradicate COVID-19. More generally, properly managing cross-cultural interactions is essential. As a series of recent reports point out, the pandemic will likely have deep and lasting effects on geopolitical relationships. Countries less impacted by the virus present lower risk of going through an economic recession. It therefore might be tempting to rapidly implement measures rather than to spend time and resources in conducting citizen assemblies across the world. Research, however, reveals the efficiency of such processes to accelerate the implementation of most effective measures.

Because countries are likely not to embrace the process in the same way, a self-regulatory regime of procedures, technologies and rules at the national level is the best we can expect. As a cornerstone of such a process, countries must increase their public access to scientific evidence and independent ethical evaluations. Many countries put the burden of ethical evaluation procedures on internal commissions, which rarely permeate to the public sphere. Further, it might be necessary for international organizations to instaure independent public debate commissions to oversee the organization and procedure of citizens assemblies across countries. Currently, existing citizens assemblies are conducted by national commissions with varying protocols and understanding of organizational and political objectives. Countries themselves must develop approaches that suit their political framework while preserving international standards. These frameworks should in turn include local scientific experts and industries, as well as international observers.

Finally, the definition of a new digital deal shares with other nascent global political alliances (e.g. the European Green Deal) the need to develop a paradigm for rebuilding political trust. Politicians and parties need to understand and actively develop effort to conduct such processes across topics. Initially, the new digital deal would need to be the work of local and national governments. In the long run, the question will be whether international organizations should nurture the new digital deal as a bottom up or a top down approach. UNESCO has well defined a global governance of cultural heritage and helps promote multilateral cooperation and collaboration to preserve humanity’s most valuable historical assets. I would argue that a new digital deal has similar potential, and deserves as much investment both financial and political.

### How interactive democracy could provide us with a digital new deal

A Digital New Deal would result from a series of efforts from various stakeholders, working at various levels and geographic scales. Because digitization is strongly linked to globalization, a Digital New Deal would also require that actions be taken across the globe, and not just in countries that have already establish digital hegemony. A Digital New Deal would need to be respectful of human diversity, cultural expressions, forms of knowledge and world views. A Digital New Deal would therefore require similar global awareness and investment then other global issues such as the pandemic, the environment and financial regulation. Up until now, the governance of such large-scale topics has work mostly as a one-way street. Powerful entities such as governments or corporations would establish guidelines and regulations to their own advantage, and repress, sometime violently, the voices of individuals and civic organization that try to change governance. This confrontational manner has been quite improductive, if not beneficial to those already holding most the political, economical and cultural power. Attempts to mediate this power relationship have been made, mostly in form of “participatory processes”, in which governance decision making process include some sort of civic and citizen input.

Interactive democracy offers a viable method for defining a value-based governance with high acceptability and rapid implementation. Consider, for example, recent citizen assemblies in charge of defining measures to reach objectives of the Paris Agreement or reshape the European Union Common Policy on Agriculture. In both cases, an interactive democratic approach fostered support among stakeholders and the national population, and increased transparency and accountability from governments. The key of such an instance is to clearly separate the roles and responsibilities of citizens, legislators, stakeholders and experts. Citizen assemblies empower participating citizens to audition elected officials, corporations, lobbies and scientific experts, thus leveraging public trust in the process. A random selection of participants across national population subsamples increases the independence, impartiality and efficiency of resulting outcomes.

In short, interactive democracy would forge the new digital deal necessary to resolve the delegitimation crisis where citizens lose their trust in political, academic and corporate leaders to uphold the social contract. Substantial barriers, however, might limit the trustworthiness of such a process. Existing ways of conceiving trust were developed without much input from common citizens. For example, what do existing data privacy regulations, designed mostly by culturally homogeneous politicians, experts and stakeholders, tell us about the values and aspirations of eight billion humans? These emerging forms of policy making surely offer qualitative new perspectives for mankind, but national and international institutions may not be receptive.

### What

- Political leadership
- Define precise goal of convention
- Random selection of inhabitants
- Can take place at many levels (local, regional, national, supranational)
- Can give rise to any “social space” (state-like, organization, community, etc.) for example: convention of Arabic hackers (if they believe it is necessary)
- Give access to experts
- Set up auditions of stake-holders


--> How is it urban? (All is urban)
