# The New Digital Deal: Digital Trust and Privacy in the Age of Urban Citizenships

The lack of policy frameworks for digital trust and data privacy exposes urban planners and designers to the risk of increasing inequalities when they conceive urban territory using digital tools and technology. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, many urban policy and governance scholars called to readdress contemporary forms of citizenships. 

In leveraging telecommunication technology in order to prevent the spread of the SARS-CoV-2, the rapid and sometime unplanned unfolding of digital solutions has disrupted several aspects of the urban social contract. One of the most pregnant consequences of this change concerns citizensâ€™ relationship to data privacy and digital trust. While new forms of interactive democracy frameworks offer potential solutions to generate ideas and awareness on issues pertaining to citizenship and digitisation, they have, in most cases, focused on other topics. 

This article delineates the development of a *New Digital Deal* that would result from such framework. It highlight how a series of citizen assemblies on digital citizenship would contribute to making urban societies more resilient to the rapid transformation of their digital ecosystem. By looking at recent cases of national citizen assemblies in Europe, it defines the means and the requirements for such a process to take place in across national and transnational contexts. A *New Digital Deal* would therefore not only have tremendous benefits on the right and protection of citizens across the globe, but also lay the foundation for more just and fair development of urban territories.
